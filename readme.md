# What is this?

This is my Visual Studio Code Inspired Portfolio, I occasionally update it with either bug fixes(Like Linkedin changing the url to my profile picture) and new projects im working on

Currently the site is mostly just a fun little experience but it does have some stuff that is pretty cool like the markdown editor actually renders out the markdown into html live! If I re-enable the editor you would be able to edit the MD files and actually see the changes in the preview pages, currently I've only implemented enough markdown to support the features that I need but in the future if I decide to unlock the editor I will try to develop the rest of markdown.

This site is actually hosted on [https://www.saladsync.ca](https://www.saladsync.ca "portfolio site")
